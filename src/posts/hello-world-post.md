### First Commit
First test post here, just wanted to give a quick shoutout to [JoyOfCode](https://joyofcode.xyz/) for their tutorial on setting up a sveltekit and Mdsvex blog setup. Another shoutout to [Josh Collinsworth](https://joshcollinsworth.com/) for his tutorial on his adaptation of a Sveltekit + Mdsvex setup. 

Click [here](https://joyofcode.xyz/sveltekit-markdown-blog#showing-a-single-post) for JoyOfCode's tutorial and [here](https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/build-static-sveltekit-markdown-blog) for Josh's tutorial if you would like to learn about it!

Some down the line considered upgrades for the blog system in loose chronological order:
- Generating signed checksum hashes for posts. (midst of rolling out)
- Setting up GraphQL for querying posts.
- Implementing some form of vectorised posts embeddings for similarity or post recommendations.
- Have posts uploaded and retrieved from the Arweave network.

(Tamper):
Previously was not using epoch time for the date field, this has been changed to allow for post sorting from various sources. Consequently, with me not planning to rerun the signs and checks, it is expected from this change (and this edit paragraph) to cause both the checksum and signature to mismatch. :D
