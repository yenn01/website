### First Commit
First test post here, just wanted to give a quick shoutout to [JoyOfCode](https://joyofcode.xyz/) for their tutorial on setting up this sveltekit and Mdsvex blog system up.

Click [here](https://joyofcode.xyz/sveltekit-markdown-blog#showing-a-single-post) if you would like to learn about it!

Some down the line considered upgrades for the blog system in loose chronological order:
- Generating signed checksum hashes for posts.
- Setting up GraphQL for querying posts.
- Implementing some form of vectorised posts embeddings for similarity or post recommendations.
- Have posts uploaded and retrieved from the Arweave network.
